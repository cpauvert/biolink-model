## Parents

 *  is_a: [Association](Association.md) - A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence

## Mixin for

 * [CellLineToDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](CellLineToDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)  - An relationship between a cell line and a disease or a phenotype, where the cell line is derived from an individual with that disease or phenotype
 * [ChemicalToDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](ChemicalToDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)  - An interaction between a chemical entity and a phenotype or disease, where the presence of the chemical gives rise to or exacerbates the phenotype
